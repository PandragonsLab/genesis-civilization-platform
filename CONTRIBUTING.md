# Contributing to GENESIS Platform

We welcome contributions to the GENESIS Civilization Emergence Platform! This document outlines how to contribute effectively.

## Quick Start

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`
3. Make your changes
4. Add tests for new functionality
5. Run the test suite: `pytest tests/`
6. Commit your changes: `git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`
7. Push to your branch: `git push origin feature/amazing-feature`

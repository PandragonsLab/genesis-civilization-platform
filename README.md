A distributed simulation platform for studying the emergence of digital civilizations through advanced multi-agent reinforcement learning, self-play algorithms, and cultural evolution mechanisms.

## üåü Key Features

- **Multi-Level Self-Play**: Individual, competitive, cooperative, and cultural learning systems
- **Bounded Specialist Agents**: Complementary limitations that encourage natural cooperation
- **Cultural Memory**: Persistent knowledge systems that accumulate across generations
- **Archipelago World**: Resource-diverse environment that incentivizes trade and specialization
- **Phase Transition Detection**: Automated detection of critical thresholds in emergence
- **Distributed Training**: Scalable training across multiple GPUs and machines
